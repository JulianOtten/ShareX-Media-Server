# Changelog

All notable changes to **ShareX Media Server** will be documented in this file.

## v1.0

The application have been completely rewritten using [Laravel 8](https://laravel.com/), [Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/2.x/introduction.html), [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The application should have all the same functionalities as the old version media server with the exception of user management, however image uploads, thumbnails generations, and image management is supported, and in a lot better way then it used to be.
